# CreateTheEscapeScheduler
An update for the Scheduling application for Create The Escape

Create The Escape Uses asp.net.  I would like to incorporate some jquery two way data binding to search for employee schedules.  
admin section will allow for an admin to login and enter in employee schedules.  
employee section will allow for employees to view schedules, search for their name and print the schedule as needed. Will look for a convert to pdf(maybe).
